Grep Console - IntelliJ plugin

Allows you to define a series of regular expressions which will be tested against the console output. Each expression matching a line will affect the style of the entire line. For example, error messages could be set to show up with a red background. 

Inspired by Grep Console plugin for Eclipse.
