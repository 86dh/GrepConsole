You can copy/paste table rows to/from plaintext.

Input filtering: 
 - usually a complete line is processed, or a text chunk if you print without a line break, but sometimes the stream is flushed prematurely (IDEA-70016). 
  Also ANSI coloring breaks the line into chunks, effectively breaking input filtering.
 - you can manipulate output text or execute any custom actions (e.g. notifications) by making your own extension plugin or by scripting via LivePlugin - https://github.com/dkandalov/live-plugin

Columns:
 - Continue matching : If checked and a line/substring is matched, then the processing will continue with next configured items to apply multiple highlights/actions.
 - Whole line : Matches a whole line (java.util.regex.Matcher#matches), otherwise finds a matching substrings (java.util.regex.Matcher#find). 
   'Unless expression' works only for the whole lines.
